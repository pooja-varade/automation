/*Finding a year is a leap or not is a bit tricky. We generally assume that if a year number is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year. But it is not the only case. A year is a leap year if âˆ’

1. It is evenly divisible by 100
2. If it is divisible by 100, then it should also be divisible by 400
3. Except this, all other years evenly divisible by 4 are leap years.*/
